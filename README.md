# Image-mirrorring
Developed in Java. Reads BMP byte by byte and mirrors the image
This project contains some redundant classes and code, as it was originally developed for a school assignment designed to demonstrate basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java by implementing an image mirroring functionality. The use of these elements may seem excessive for such a simple task, but they were included to fulfill the educational objectives of the assignment.
